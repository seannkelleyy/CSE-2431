Part I: Before Using the Simple Test Cases:

1. Create a `test' directory in your home directory by

$ mkdir test

2. Copy this test-lab1.txt file into the test directory by

$ cp test-lab1.txt ~/test/

3. Copy YOUR `lab1-shell.c' into the test directory by

$ cp lab1-shell.c ~/test/

4. Compile your `lab1-shell.c' in test directory, you can use
makefile if you like, or simply use

$ gcc -g lab1-shell.c -o mysh 

Now, if there is no error, you can begin to test your small
shell, ;-).

$ ./mysh


Part II: Sample Test Cases

----
COMMAND-> mv test-lab1.txt help 
Expected Results: The `test-lab1.txt' file in the `test' directory should be
renamed as `help'.
----

----
COMMAND-> cat help 
Expected Results: The content of this file should be printed onto the
screen.
----

----
COMMAND-> ./mysh
Expected Results: Start a second `mysh' shell in the first `mysh' shell.
The command prompt should be waiting for user's input.  When 
you press `Ctrl+d', you should go back into your first `mysh', 
still having a "COMMAND-> " waiting for input.
